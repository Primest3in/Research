String matching is a fundamental problem in computer science with numerous applications
in areas such as information retrieval, bio-informatics, and natural language processing. One
classical variant of this problem is the "All-Pair Suffix-Prefix Matching," which involves finding
the longest matching prefixes of some strings with the suffixes of other strings, across all possible
pairs. The existing solutions for this problem are limited to offline scenarios, where the entire data
set is known beforehand. But whenever new strings are inserted, the model of existing solutions
needs to be run again which is computationally slow. In our proposed model, we introduce a novel
approach to address this limitation by proposing a dynamic model for online string insertion. Our
proposed model not only efficiently computes all-pair suffix-prefix matches with existing strings
but also seamlessly accommodates new string insertions.
Our model uses advanced data structures and algorithms to enable real-time matching when
new strings are inserted. The key challenge lies here is to handle dynamic updates while optimizing
time complexity. In conclusion, this thesis presents a significant advancement in the field of online
string matching by introducing a dynamic all-pair suffix-prefix matching model.
